# Progress Report 1

The semester has been crushingly difficult for both of us since the proposal,
so we really haven't gotten a *whole* lot done. The workload should let up a
day or two after we get back, so we expect to actually get cracking at that
point. In terms of the short-term goals, we have begun to play with density
functions in a prebuilt marching cubes reference that we found online.
Interestingly, the "lumpy" one from the noise examples produces sloping,
mountainous terrain when plugged directly into this marching cubes
implementation.

Thus, we think our next goal is to roll our own marching cubes implementation,
probably plugging it into a somewhat premade framework, like the one for the
solar system lab. We don't think any big roadblocks have come up so far, and
somewhat to the contrary, a lot of the concepts make *more* sense to us than
when we proposed.
